				<h1>It's all about Hard work and Consistent</h1>
				<h2>1. How to be consistent to achieve your own fitness goal?</h2>
				<p>
					We know that the way to reach your goal no matter what goal you decided to achieve is all about hardwork and be patient and consistant. 
					However there are not much people able to reach thier goal,especially fitness.
					You can just simply look around and you able to realise that the people in the world is getting weaker or overweight or too skinny. 
					I can ensure that they all have tried to do workout to reach their goal, but most of the time they just can't stick to the workout and diet.
					This is because they <b>CONSUME</b> too much calories more than <b>WORKOUT</b> that burn the calories.That's why people failed to reach the goal.
					So here we are gonna give suggestion and a good way to be consistant and the good way to reach your own fitness goal.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>2. Do the most important thing in the beginning of your day.</h2>
				<p>
					I believe that if you entered this site your most important thing will be your workout.
					Why it is so important to do the most important thing in the morning is because if let's say 
					you persist to put your workout in the end of the day(last thing to do in your day), 
					can you really do it at the night that you already used up a lot of energy for your work?
					If you do then I hope you can stick to it everyday, just remember you have to do it for your entire life because fitness is about your life.
					You have so many days need to live and sometime your manager need you to O.T for some project.
					In this case you have no choice to skip your workout. 
					So this is why you should done your workout in the beginning of the day to ensure you able to do workout every single day.
