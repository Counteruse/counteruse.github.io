				<h1>How to avoid Binge Eating Disorders?</h1>
				<h2>Introduction of Binge Eating.</h2>
				<p>
					Binge eating means that you eat a lot of calories (more than you expected) in a short amount of time. It is similar to have cheat day. But cheat day is a day of reward your hardwork and binge eating will make you feel depressed and  
					you will hate yourself after binge eating. Even it will make your stomach feel really uncomfortable and you will give up
					in achieving your fitness goal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Binge eating is also a biggest enemy for the fitness stuff.Besides,Binge eating also known as a Habit.
				</p>
				<p>
					The worst thing is if you unable to overcome the binge issues,it will just become one part of your life. 
					This means you will binge everyday.This is the worst case for everyone.

				<br>
				<h2>Things to do after binge and how to overcome binge eating habits.</h2>
				<br>
				<h3>1. Drink a lot of water</h3>
				<p>
					This is because it will help you to flush out all the crappy food in your body. 
					It might make you feel more uncomfortable because you consumed a lot of sodium from binge eating,but this is the way to clean up your body.
				</p>
				<p>Know what trigger you to binge eating</p>
				<p>
					There must be a reason on why you binge,try write down in a notebook in order to stay away from the trigger. 
					For example,you just feeling too hungry.Or you are just too stressed?
				</p>
				<p>
					Because each bite you feel like the stress is going away but this means the more you stressed the more you binge. 
					Try to find something that able to let you forget the stress (The best choice is just go workout.)
					Try to love yourself, simply worrying doesn't make the problems solved. 
					Why not just try to calm down yourself,may be have a nap? 
					I am sure that you will feel a lot of better after you have a refreshent to yourself.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>2. Do not punish yourself in the gym.</h3>
				<p>
					This is the most common mistake that people always did. 
					This is because if let's say you do 1000reps of workout in the gym and you really burn off those calories in your body.
					Moreover , you said to yourself that you are not gonna having those crappy junk food in your fitness journey.
					May be you able to stick to it for somedays.But if one day you binge again and you do the samething to burn the calories.
					Now,I ensure you fall into a binge cycle already. 
					That's means you make your body know that you will workout extremely hard after your binge,so it will just continue like 
					(you binged -> you hate yourself -> workout really hard in the gym ->use too much calories and then binge again -> repeating)
					if you don't do something to break the cycle it will just continue for your life and one day 
					if you will feel too exhausted to workout extremely hard to burn the tone of calories but 
					the binge cycle is still going,it cause you feeling more depressed and then you gain a lot of weight and fat and then you give up.
					In the end,you unable to reach your goal but you gained more weight than usual.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>3. Eat more to binge less</h3>
				<p>
					Somepeople might say that eating more equal to binge. 
					The things is binging food is eating a lot of calories in short time which can make you feel uncomfortable in your stomach.
					Eating more can be eat a meal every 2-3 hours in a day. 
					So it will be like you only eat after your previous meal is 90% digested instead of making combination of junk food and just like non-stop eating. 
					Although you might consume higher calories but it is always better than you binge.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>4. Don't dieting</h3>
				<p>
					Dieting means that you very strict to your diet such as no sugar,no carbonhydrates, 
					no fat to every meals.Which means you take away the "fun stuff" of eating.
					Even you will not allow yourself to eat fruit although it is healthy but it contains sugar and carbonhydrates. 
					So in someday,you are just really crave to some food that you can't hold yourself any longer.Your body just tell you it want the food 
					and then you ate the food that you restricted in your diet.At this moment,you feel like "Crap,I ate something that I should'nt have.
					"but the taste of the food that you restricted is just taste so good tht you can't hold anymore, 
					so you will have another one and then more and more until you binge.
					That's why dieting don't work to fitness journey because it is too hard. 
					Our "will power" is not enough unless you work as a bodybuilder so that your entire life is just about muscle building and dieting.
					But for us,we got our own lifestyle,we already feel stressed at outside work and now you still adding trouble to yourself which is dieting.
					Allowing yourself have a food that you like for your snack is a really good way to beat up the food cravings
					so that you can make sure you won't binge.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>5. Don't stress</h3>
				<p>
					This is the hardest part.Nowadays,people having a lot of stress during thier work time. 
					Sometime they having trouble in their own business such like failed to negotiate with thier client or manager
					are rushing some big projects and causing a lot of pressure to them that need to overtime work without adding any extra salary. 
					Hence,when they get back to home,most of the time the sweet,unhealthy junk food will be their threatment. 
					They don't have enough "will power" to stop them to eat.
					But actually they are adding more stress to their ownself because they have to workout extra hard in the gym.
					So,what I suggested is just don't stress.If you able to control your own condition then things will become a lot better.

				<h2>The tips you can overcome your stress is:</h2>
				<h3>1. Do not worry.</h3>
				<p>
					Things are already happened,it is just wasting your time to worry about it,unless there are something can make the time go back.
					You are not work alone in the company.You can try seeking for someone suggestion to help you solve the problem.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>2. Exercise</h3>
				<p>
					Many people think that exercise is just for improving own personal physique.
					Some of them even think that exxercise is just adding more stress to thier ownself.
				</p>
				<p>
					That's is not true.Exercising doesn't means you must go to the gym and lift weight for an hour. 
					It can be dancing,slow jog or just go invite your friends to any sports you like. 
					Because,after exercise you will actually become more calm and your brain will be refreshed. 
					So,it is making you able to think that"eating junk food"are actually adding more stress and not the exercising did.
					You even feel more comfortable after exercising because you get a lot of benefits from it such like your physique is improved 
					and your body are more healthier.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>3. Talk to your friend</h3>
				<p>
					Because not only you in the world are facing stress.
					By sharing your stress with your friends are another good way to make yourself more comfortable. 
					Most of the time your friends are already faced the problem that you are facing now.
					Hence they can give you some way to solve it. At the end,you will think that the stress you facing is actually just a small issue.
