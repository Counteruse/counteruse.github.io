				<h1>In this page we'r gonna discuss how to stick to diet,what to eat to have sixpack or at least have a flat stomach and so-on.</h1>
				<h2>How important for eating a clean diet to get the results?</h2>
				<p>
					Here are a personal trainer from Malaysia are going to explain to you how important is stick to a diet plan and how much calories should you take.
				</p>

				<p>
					Based on the research, diet play an important role more than workout. 
					The ratio is about 80% nutrition and 20% on workout.There is also a phrase that is "Abs are made in kitchen". 
					Besides,I think you already have seen that a lot of successful fitness model on youtube said that they have workout really hard in the gym, 
					but they never see the results. They also express that the hardest part is not workout and it is diet part.
					Many people expect that they able to burn like thousand of calories during their workout for may be just 30 mins, 
					but the truth is you only able to burn 1000 of calories with at least 1 hours of HIGH INTENSITY OF HARDWORK.
					So,in order to burn up the crappy calories in your body,you really should eat as clean as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand,after you able to stick with your diet which is eating healthy and you able to lose some weight in the first two weeks. 
					But suddenly,you noticed that you are stuck in there.You just maintain the weight and unable to lose weight.Most of the time
					you will able to lose weight in the first two weeks is because of some reasons:
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>1. You are losing water weight.</h2>
				<p>
					Water weight is basicly you consume the water that contains a lot of sugar and calories.
					So if you just simply change it to the plain water you will able to lose a lot of water weight.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>2. Eat too much of healthy food</h2>
				<p>
					No matter how clean diet you are eating,you also need to monitor your calories intake. 
					So,people after saw this might ask what's the different of eating healthy food and dirty food if both also need to monitor the calories intake. 
					The different is healthy food can be consumed a lot but it contains a very low calories only. 
					But for the unhealthy food such as oreo,you simply just eat 2 pieces of oreo and you get 200 calories already. 
					Hence,try to compete between 2 fruits = 200 calories and 2 oreo = 200 calories.
					That's why healthy food can make you feel fuller.
